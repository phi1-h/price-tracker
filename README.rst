Phil's Amazon Price Tracker
=======================

A  project that exists as an aid to monitor any product price on amazon.

This is my first project, please contribute and be nice :)
I will add examples soon on how to use my Price Tracker

----

This is the README file for the project.

The file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using ReStructured Text. It
will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as
the project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be written for
that purpose.

Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not
a good idea, although a simple "What's New" section for the most recent version
may be appropriate.
